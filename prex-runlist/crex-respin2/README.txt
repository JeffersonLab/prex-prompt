This folder represents post-CREX respin2 evaluation of runs, and should match the labelling that has been ultimately determined by the WACs. 
For the run list used to generate respin2 itself see the simple_list/all_crex.list, which is the stale copy from the crex-respin2_alpha (and contains many runs besides just production or good labelled runs)
Also, the respin2 lists that were used to generate the JAPAN rootfiles live in the parallel folder "crex-respin2_alpha"

Good run lists to use for subsequent analyses:
  The runlist that should be used for post-processing offline analyses is simple_list/all_production (includes the needcut and suspicious production runs too)
  And the one that should be used for a grand total of Good Production only runs is simple_list/all_production_good_only.list
